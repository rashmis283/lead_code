### Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider, aims to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying "Hot Leads" that have a higher probability of converting. The current conversion rate is approximately 30%, and the company seeks to increase this to 80%.

### Business Objective
The objective is to develop a model that assigns a lead score between 0-100 to each lead, helping the sales team focus on high-potential leads and improve the conversion rate.

### Approach
The analysis involved:
- **Data Import and Preparation**: Handling missing values, creating dummy variables for categorical data, and cleaning the dataset.
- **EDA**: Understanding the distribution of data and identifying key factors that influence lead conversion.
- **Model Building**: Using logistic regression to build a predictive model, with feature selection and evaluation metrics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves.

### Key Findings
- Leads from HR, Finance, and Marketing specializations are more likely to convert.
- Leads originating from Google and direct traffic have higher conversion rates.
- Unemployed individuals show a greater interest in the courses.
- The model achieved an accuracy of 80% on both training and test data.

### Conclusion
The analysis provided actionable insights, enabling the company to prioritize leads more effectively. Recommendations include focusing on leads from specific sources and specializations, as well as improving engagement strategies for high-potential leads.
